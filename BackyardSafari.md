DOCUMENTATION for BACKYARD SAFARI

The primary object of this project is to create "Pokemon Go 

with real animals". People have always have done bird watching, 

or have looked for moose in the mountains of Colorado or alligators

and iguanas in the wetlands of Florida. This game puts a competitive 

spin on these pasttimes. 


At the forest level, this application will allow people to form games

with a "master" or "it" person who identifies an animal and its name by 

an uploaded picture of it. The members of the game then have to find 

that animal in real life and take a picture of it and upload itself into

the game. The master will then be able to see the uploaded pictures and 

make a decision based upon the picture about who either "won" the session

or who got how many points. Perhaps there could be automatic or manual 

point schedule set by the Master of the game. Eventually, it could be great 

if we could have several of these games going on in paralell.  


In term of the actual architecture and challenges that we will face, there 

will be the need to have the ability for our server to host the application and 

also have a host for storage node to store all of the data we are storing. Then

we will have to figure out how to create a database that we can use to store 

everything that we need. We also need to figure out a way that games, users, 

and entities are stored. Beyond having the date, we need to be able to build 

a front end that can show the images and perform the in game and out of game 

transactions between place. Last but not least, we need to find a way to have

our users create accounts and log-in.
